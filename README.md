# senv - Switch .env Files

Effortlessly switch between .env files using `senv <suffix>`. With no dependencies too.

## Installation

```bash
# Built on Node. Not Deno, sorry :(
npm install -g @neuronbutter/senv
pnpm install -g @neuronbutter/senv
yarn global add @neuronbutter/senv
```

## Usage

When using senv, the `.env` file is always assumed to be linked, and so senv will remove and replace it without prompting. **_Don't only keep your variables in `.env`, otherwise you'll risk losing them forever._**

By default, `dev` is the assumed suffix for a `.env` file.

For quiet operation, append the `-q` flag to the *end* of the command. Note that any error messages will still be printed.

### Examples

```bash
# Link .env to .env.prod
senv prod
```

```bash
# Link .env to .env.dev quietly
senv dev -q
```
